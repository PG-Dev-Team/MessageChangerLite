MessageChanger is a plugin allowing you to change the default messages of Spout / Vanilla / and other games (hopefully) based on permissions.

It also allows changing of the default deathmessages with random ones based on the deathcause.

It is easy to extend, so if you have deathcauses which are not supported (because they are added by a plugin or game) let the developer of that plugin / game and me know so that we can update this plugin.

Pull Requests are always welcome and earn you a place in the hall of fame... ähh... pom.xml :-)
